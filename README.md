## Getting Started

## Build Setup

###Yarn

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# start dev server at localhost:4000
yarn start

# build project
yarn build
```

###Bundling For Production

It needs to run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to build this backend project and need to add the frontend build distribution in to a new folder called build-fe inside build folder.


###Serve In Production
Here [PM2](https://pm2.io/doc/en/runtime/overview/) has used as the process manager. So mention 
environment variables in the ecosystem.config.js file, which has created in .env file 
(.env.default has needed variables) in the development stage.
